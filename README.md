# nox-plugin-proposal

Small demo of what comes to mind for a nox plugin system mimicking pytest's system

## Caveat

This is an incredibly rough draft and exists mostly just to communicate an idea to see if others are interested in 
moving this direction.

Personally I'm really biased toward Pytest plugins and general pytest structures, but that may not be the best way 
forward. Not to mention, if anyone has a better way to solve the issues I have encountered then that's the ideal 
situation, since this is quite a heavy proposal.
